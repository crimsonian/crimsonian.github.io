Laurie and Crimson have a conversation with [Dr. Michael Fix](http://www2.gsu.edu/~mfix/Home.html), mostly to discuss the implications of an 8 person SCOTUS, but we end up discussing the value of social science research. Of course, we have to discuss the recent RBG controversy, and the realities of how ideology plays a role in the judicial system. Dr. Fix breaks down the differences between our court systems from the local to federal level and how they all work together and are equally important to our democracy. Basically, you get a college course on the judicial system, without having to pay for the credit hour. As Donald Trump would say, what do you have to lose? Unless we convince you into a social science graduate degree, then you could lose a lot of cash, but have a fulfilling existence.
