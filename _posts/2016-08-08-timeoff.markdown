We told you that we would be taking a week off, but one week became two. Not because we enjoyed having some time off, but because Laurie lost a loved one and is spending time with her family, while juggling all of her other #adulting realities. Please keep her and her family in your thoughts.

So we will be back very soon for our weekly glasses of wine and chit-chat about the current events. Plan on seeing us on your itunes podcast feed mid-next week, follow us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/crimsonianpodcast), or checkback here.  Also, look for our first Conversations Series Episode, being released this week!
