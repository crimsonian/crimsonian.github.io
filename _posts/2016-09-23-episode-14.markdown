Last week Laurie was dying from the Scottish Plague and this week Crimson is dying from pink eye, but that doesn’t stop us from the much needed therapy session about the devastating news that Brangelina are now just Brad and Angie. We then move on to Crimson’s attempt to objectively evaluate candidates in a world that facts no longer matter. We discuss how we define human character and how the candidates stack up against the traits we look for when we are getting to know someone and trying to find the core of their being. Then Crimson sells out for an old but relevant mini-series [Hatfield & McCoy’s](http://www.history.com/shows/hatfields-and-mccoys/articles/the-hatfield-mccoy-feud). Through the mini-series we see the hate that war breeds, and the consequence of a divided nation.
