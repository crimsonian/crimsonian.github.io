The ladies catch up discussing the amazing, unprecedented, Trump press conference, where we got a taste of just how insane this President really may be. We highlight our favorite moments, but then move onto the holiday of the week, Valentine’s Day. We give a preview of some of the Valentines that likely came out of the Trump administration, but then move on to talking about love. While Valentine’s Day is typically about intimate love, we broaden the scope to communal love. Given our country is divided between “us and them” we thought it would be a good time to discuss why and the implications of such. Then we close out with Laurie selling out for (Hate Thy Neighbor)[https://www.viceland.com/en_us/show/hate-thy-neighbor] a Vice series that explores the hate in our country.
