Listen to Laurie and Crimson start upbeat about the prospects of a Hillary Clinton presidency and then the fallout after the big blow. Laurie drops out, its just too much, and Crimson rants. Just listen, unless you are like Crimson and just over it all. In that case, wait a few days. There are some good moments to catch, like us singing, but this is the first episode that is basically unedited and even Crimson hasn't listened to. Its just too soon. So please excuse us while we mourn.
