We can’t help but to spend the hour talking about the RNC Convention. As liberals, it would be very easy to just laugh at all of the controversy and scandal. But instead we outline some of the [incompetencies](http://mashable.com/2016/07/15/trump-pence-update-internet/#MW3Y9MgeVkqj), and try to dissect why it is going so poorly. Then we make our best guesses of what's to come from the DNC’s convention next week.
