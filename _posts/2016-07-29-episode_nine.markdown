Laurie decides to start her week by taking on the universe after it took a precious earing from her and that resulted in her then having to buy a new AC unit, and us losing some of our audio file. Crimson discusses her warm fuzzies throughout the convention and her undeniable love and bias for the Democratic Party, while being challenged by the much less Democrat loving Laurie. Somehow we end up talking about Bill Clinton’s shenanigans, but Crimson shuts that shit down because she can’t cope with the concept of the Clinton marriage being a sham. And mostly, we say goodbye to Bernie Sanders and remind his supporters that while it’s time to move on, they should do so with pride.
