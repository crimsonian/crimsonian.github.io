Crimson goes on a rant about the downfalls of today's competitiveness in extracurricular sports and then we catch up on Orlando and its new tragedy. We contemplate life, post the Orlando terrorist attack under a Trump regime and the implications of his rhetoric. Laurie gives a strong endorsement for watching [“60 Days In”](http://www.aetv.com/shows/60-days-in) and we start a conversation about the disaster that is the US prison system. And Crimson sells out for the [“Tyme Iron."](http://www.tymestyle.com/)
