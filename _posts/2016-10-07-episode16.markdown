The ladies catch up with a discussion of the Vice Presidential debate performances by Tim Kaine and Mike Pence. Laurie talks about Hurricane Matthew, [and the flock of birds at risk](http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article106748712.html), which totally canceled Crimson’s family vacation. After a sellout to [the Anchor, OTR](http://www.theanchor-otr.com/) we discuss the repulsive, or enjoyable nature of oysters. Crimson gave the a try once, in [Rhode Island](http://www.rhodyoysters.com/], and finds it to be the most repulsive thing ever, but Laurie loves them, and they are delicious at the Anchor. Then we dive into discussion about how the concept of individual perception is difficult to negotiate with the realities or facts of life.

How do we come to terms with the fact everyone lives in their perceptions, but some have self awareness that others do not? Crimson wants to find the justice in it all, but Laurie keeps it real and points out some more practical implications. At the end of the day, you can’t change humans, you have to learn to accept them, regardless of their perceptions...well maybe. Crimson may disagree? On an related notes we discuss two awesome books [the Year of Living Biblically](https://www.amazon.com/Year-Living-Biblically-Literally-Possible/dp/0743291484), a book about a mans pursuit to live literally as the Bible commands. Also, [Whats the Matter with Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_the_Matter_with_Kansas%3F), where Thomas Frank trys to explain why some voters vote against their best interest.
