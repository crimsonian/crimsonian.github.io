After an exhausting couple of weeks in Trump country, the ladies try to focus on one of the most disturbing things to come out of the administration, the idea of alternative facts. But first, they catch up and talk about the Woman’s March and the adorable new [baby hippo at the Cincinnati Zoo](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/childrens-hospital-nicu-staff-sends-premature-baby-hippo-a-care-package/). After acknowledging the amazingly horrid [Inauguration outfit that Kellyanne Conway wore](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/01/20/kellyanne-conway-inauguration-outfit-love-it-or-hate-it/), we discuss her next biggest contribution to the world, #alternativefacts. And in hopes to keep things light, Laurie and Crimson present their own alternative facts. We finish up with a good ole’ sell out for Canada!
