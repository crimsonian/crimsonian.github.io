I have to hand it to Cincinnati, Bunbury was a well executed and entertaining festival. The band line up was great, while not overwhleming. Everything ran almost flawlessly, even after some weather complications. We had a super fun time and while Laurie and Jason suffered through the weather, I only attended Sunday, which was an exceptionally beauitful June day. I couldn't have asked for a more relaxing, awesome afternoon. Oh, and for those other Cincinnatians, I thought this shirt would make you giggle, like it did me.
