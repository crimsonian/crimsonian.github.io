Crimson recommends everyone watch Weiner, the documentary about Anthony Weiner’s attempt to re-enter politics. It’s a captivating experience that really immerses you into the absolute disaster that is his life. Which leads us to [Esther Perel’s Ted Talk on infidelity](http://www.ted.com/talks/esther_perel_rethinking_infidelity_a_talk_for_anyone_who_has_ever_loved?language=en), where she walks us through the realities of infidelity and how we need to reshape the way we think about something that is almost inevitable in today’s world. Laurie and Crimson “intellectualize” about the concepts of monogamy, infidelity and the gray space that is sexuality, love and companionship. Laurie also gives us some insight into John Gottman’s theory of the [four horsemen that represent the end of a relationship](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-the-antidotes/).
