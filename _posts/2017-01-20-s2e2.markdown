First we catch up, with Laurie telling us about her fun times with estate planning and Crimson marks her 20th day without buying anything materialistic. Take that corporate America! Then we move on to this week’s discussion about feminism. Given there are thousands of women across the globe uniting together to march for equality, we thought what better time to discuss feminism. We define it, shoot down some myths, and then have a lengthy discussion about why it may have a bad reputation with younger women. We then review the principles behind the 1/21/17 [Womens March](https://www.womensmarch.com/principles/), in hopes to circumvent the potential misinformation about its purpose of the march and the motivations behind those attending. We close out by selling out for Mr. Robot, an USA original series that is a dramatic interpretation of many progressives frustrations with capitalism.
