We catch up with an update on the only heart warming story in the news- the baby hippo Fionna and then we nerd out about the new solar system found by NASA. Next we move on to the obvious story of the week- the recusal of Jeff Sessions from all things Russia. Given his Senate statement is only seen as a lie by the left, we discuss what it means to lie and how we should define it. Laurie and Crimson then provide some lie translations in hopes to protect our listeners from being lied to in the future. We sell out this week for [The People v. OJ Simpson; American Crime Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People_v._O._J._Simpson:_American_Crime_Story).
