This may be our most important conversation. As the Republicans try to ram through edits to Obamacare, it is important to understand the true implications of this new bill. We discuss the failures of the ACA, and how the AHCA does absolutely nothing to fix them. In fact, it adds new challenges to an unstable market, and kicks all Trump supporters in the balls. Oh yeah, Crimson talks about an empowering documentary [Code:Debugging the Gender Gap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VVb6M8pTvE) that everyone should watch to understand women's role in technology and the importance of teaching all women coding. Then Laurie sells out for [3 Little Pixies Etsy Shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/3LittlePixiesShoppe) where she got our kick ass women power bracelets.
