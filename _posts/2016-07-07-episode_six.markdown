Crimson talks about fulfilling a lifelong dream of seeing Guns N' Roses. We make tribute to Kentucky’s great new family attraction, [the Ark Encounter](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ark-encounter-noahs-ark-theme-park-got-18-million-in-kentucky-state-tax-incentives/),  and then we discuss the tragedy of the recent deaths of innocent men at the hands of those meant to protect us.

Definitely check out [Lin Manuel Miranda at the White House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8_ARd4oKiI) and [Beyonce’s Lemonade](http://www.beyonce.com/album/lemonade-visual-album/) and let us know what you think. Also, in case you wanted more information about the perceptions of whites vs. blacks here is more info on how differently [black and white people view race](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-eye-opening-facts-about-how-differently-black-and-white-people-view-race_us_5773f678e4b0eb90355d1234), and about how [our schools are more segregated than ever before](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/08/29/report-public-schools-more-segregated-now-than-40-years-ago/
).
