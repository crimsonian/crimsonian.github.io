Crimson closes out her concert series with Jenny Lewis and Laurie, hopefully, closes out her shitty month that ended with the passing of a loved one. Crimson gets all philosophical about the concept of chores and Laurie keeps it real with some clinical perspective. But her personal experience is almost more insightful. We actively avoid politics and just discuss the Olympics; the good, the bad, the ugly and the inspiring. Then we close out by selling out for Stranger Things, a show that both ladies agree, kicks ass.

Oh and here is the [awesomeness](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3743180/The-time-man-wishes-SMALLER-penis-Japanese-pole-vaulter-s-Olympic-dream-crushed-manhood-knocks-bar-off.html) that Laurie promised.
