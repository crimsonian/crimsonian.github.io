We catch up with Laurie discussing a couple experiences that gave her faith in humanity in the wake of last week's tragedies. Crimson tries to apologize to Ken Ham, but fails miserably. We say goodbye to the Bernie Sanders campaign at a time when the “system” he railed against is our only hope to help improve the lives of those we fear for today. Somehow, we end up talking about [Joni Ernst castrating pigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9Y24MFOfFU)? And to keep things light we discuss the shared economy and [Robert Reich’s perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_Snob8-6xM) and recommendations on how to evolve our infrastructure to account for the changing obstacles for our new workforce. Then Crimson sells out for President Obama, and his [inspriring words](http://digg.com/2016/obama-dallas-full-speech-bush) at such a difficult time.
