Yeah, yeah, yeah, Trump took a dump on Earth this week, but we are over talking about the orangutan. After catching up on Crimson’s neighborhood battle and Laurie’s deck renovation, we chat about liberal college students inability to accept hearing the other side. Campuses should be a place where there is an exchange of ideas, yet the new generation of students prefer to shut that shit down. We also start a new segment “what we are grateful for” as an attempt to bring some positivity to Trumpland; and this week we are thankful for ‘Merica (fuck yeah). We close out the episode with a sell out for [No-Drama Discipline](https://www.amazon.com/No-Drama-Discipline-Whole-Brain-Nurture-Developing/dp/034554806X) a parenting self-help book that has helped Crimson with the transition of parenting a toddler to parenting a kid.
