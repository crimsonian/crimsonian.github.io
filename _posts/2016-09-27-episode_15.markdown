Laurie gives us an all important update on the Brangelina drama, and then we dig into all things debate night. Crimson tries to buy a bottle of The Federalist Zinfandel, featuring her favorite founding father, [Thomas Jefferson](http://www.drinkhacker.com/2010/06/14/review-2007-the-federalist-zinfandel/) but instead buys the version with George Washington on, which is a total buzz kill and embarrassment. The ladies try to break down debate night by discussing the fashion, our favorite moments, and our overall assessment of the real impact of the debate.

Laurie sells out for the [The Cincinnati Food and Wine Festiva](http://cincinnatifoodandwineclassic.com/)l and Crimson shockingly sells out for [John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Lfd1aB9YI) because of his brilliant way of putting the “Clinton scandals” in perspective of this election and her competition. Oh and check out [Hillary Clinton on Between Two Ferns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrkPe-9rM1Q) and let us know if it is as awkward for you as it was for Crimson.
