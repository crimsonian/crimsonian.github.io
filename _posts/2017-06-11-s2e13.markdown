In our first episode since switching to Laurie’s new office for recording, we can’t help but talk all things Comey. Laurie makes it obvious that she was distracted by Comey’s good looks, while Crimson was distracted with the reality that Comey was treated like a sexually harassed woman. Comey got grabbed by the pussy, figuratively of course. Laurie then sells out for a new nonfiction book [Life and Other Near Death Experiences](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Near-Death-Experiences-Camille-Pag%C3%A1n-ebook/dp/B00U6IQFFU).
